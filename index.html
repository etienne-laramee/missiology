							<h1>Responding to a pressing need</h1>
						</p>
						<p>
							The creation of an Education Leadership Chair in Evangelical Protestant missiology aims to put missiology at the centre of theological studies.  The Chair seeks to articulate through research and instruction a missional theology in Québec’s post Christian context by examining the relationship of faith and culture.  The Chair constitutes a concrete response to current challenges faced by congregations in their efforts to bear witness in word and deed to Jesus and all his teachings to our contemporaries.  It will be part of Université Laval’s Faculty of Theology and Religious Sciences and will reflect the university’s tradition of excellence in education and research and concretize its openness to other Christian traditions.
						</p>
						<p>
							Missional theology is now at the heart of reflection and action of Christian churches worldwide.  Missio Dei establishes the priority of the triune God’s being in action therefore characterizing God as a missionary God.  In this case mission cannot be conceived of primarily or even essentially as an activity or program of the Church but must be rooted in God.
						</p>
						<p>
							Missiology is the exegetical, theological and cultural study about the mission of God in the world and the ensuing task of the church. For that reason it is often defined as an inter-disciplinary field of reflection and action. When one shapes this discussion contextually and pursues this reflection in contexts of post-Christendom, one is seeking to relate culture, society mission. Missiology seeks a more adequate understanding of the apostolic mission of the Church while remaining faithful to the exegetical task of understanding the mind of the Biblical writers.
						</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="grid-12 content-benefits">
						<p>
							<h1>Benefits</h1>
						</p>
						<p>
							The generation of research, analysis, resources and innovative practical strategies for doing mission in a post Christian North America (Canada and the United States)
						</p>
						<p>
							<h2>Potential Resources created by the Chair</h2>
						</p>
						<p>
							The North American Post Christian Summer School, an annual week long event in beautiful Québec City with the goal of equipping the North-American Church to confront the challenges presented by a Post-Christian Society.  The Summer School will offer participants access to the best theologians, missiologists, philosophers, historians, ethicists and sociologists.
						</p>
						<p>
							It will comprise two (2) days of conferences given by experts in their fields, followed by one (1) day of group discussions (groups will be based on personal function: professors, pastors, missionaries, members of mission organisations, and lay believers) and one (1) day of mini seminars offering participants to share and discuss their experience and understanding.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Quebec Forum on Post Christianity</strong>, an annual event for students, missiologists and pastors with the goal of creating a public space for discussion, reflection and analysis of the relationship between the Christian faith and the post-Christian culture.
						</p>
						<p>
							In a climate of openness and without consideration of confessional affiliations, the forum will provide a platform for all who desire to share ideas and make know practices that could potentially provide a contribution in support of our mission.  Participation at events and meetings of the forum will permit the creation of social networks which will encourage the interaction and the sharing of experiences.

					<div class="grid-12 content-joining-the-dialogue">
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								&ldquo;In a changing American culture, how should Christians respond?  What is the future of American churches and Christianity in America?  We need to understand where our culture is headed!   We need to gain a new, more mission-minded understanding of being Christian in America!  We need to think more like missionaries here at home!
							</p>
							<p>
								Quebec, Canada is already there, a highly secularized Quebec society and a shrinking Christian presence.  We can learn from them.  We can prepare for our own future.  We can support this endeavour for the sake of Christ’s church in Quebec . . . and for the sake of Christ’s church in America.&rdquo;

							<h1>Pertinent questions addressed by missiology</h1>
						</p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>The place of the study of mission in Theological Education?</li>
								<li>How should Christians involved in mission relate to those of other faith traditions?</li>
								<li>What are the implications for mission of the shift of poles of Christianity towards the east?</li>
								<li>What is the future of the church in the West?  Can the West be saved again?</li>
								<li>How can Christian mission become good news to people whose livers are structured and limited by wars, systematic oppression, hunger and violence?</li>
								<li>Should we speak of the mission of the church, in the singular, or the missions of the church, in the plural, which would give birth to different forms of Christianity (eg. a faith community in a region of extreme poverty that is organized as a community center)?</li>
								<li>What is mission?  The missio Dei shift (our mission from the perspective of God’s mission) and its implications?</li>

					<div class="grid-12 content-a-pertinent-question">
						<p>
							<h1>Why a Chair in Evangelical Protestant missiology at a <u>Catholic Publicly Funded</u> University?</h1>
						</p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Laval has trained many Masters and Doctoral evangelical students over the years.</li>
								<li>Three evangelical theological schools are presently associated with Laval, through whom they have received accreditation (ETEM/IBVIE, ITF and IBQ).</li>
								<li>Missiology requires an inter-disciplinary approach integrating knowledge from the fields of the human sciences, sociology of religion, anthropology, hermeneutics, philosophy, epistemology, … Laval has experts in these fields on site.</li>
								<li>Laval has the expertise required to study the relationship between faith and culture in Québec:  the Catholic heritage is essential to the understanding of this relationship.</li>
								<li>The Faculty of Theology at Laval will soon be the only Faculty of Theology in Québec at a publicly funded University.</li>
								<li>The Faculty of Theology wants to consolidate its presence and open up to other Christian traditions.</li>
								<li>Laval is the oldest public institution in the province of Québec.</li>
								<li>The return on investment on the Chair is very high.  After the initial seven years of existence, the University assumes the complete cost of the Chair holder’s salary, a 14% return for as long as the Chair exists.</li>
